# React Priority List
### Description
This is a priority list/to-do list web page created using the React JavaScript Framework. Use it to keep track of the tasks you need to complete.
All tasks are sorted by due date, so the highest priority tasks will be at the top of the list.
### How to use the Project
1. Enter a priority's name, a due date, and the expected amount of time to complete.
2. Click the "Add" button to add the priority to the list. (If any fields are invalid, you will be prompted to fix them.)
#### Categories
1. At the top of the page you will see a menu titled "Categories." This menu allows you to color-code your priorities. The currently selected category color will be highlighted in the menu, while all other colors will be greyed out. To change the selected color, simply click on a color in the menu.
2. When adding a priority to the list, its category will be whatever color is currently selected. A priority's category can be changed after creation by selecting a new color in the menu and clicking on the priority in the list.
3. The category color is set to "none" by default.
